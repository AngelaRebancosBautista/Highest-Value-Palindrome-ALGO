# Highest-Value-Palindrome-ALGO

This C# program solves the Richieâ€™s Richest Palindrome problem: it makes a numeric string the largest possible palindrome by changing at most k digits. It first ensures the string is a palindrome by mirroring higher digits, then maximizes the value by changing digits to 9 wherever possible, considering the remaining allowed changes.
